2010-04-29    VERSION 1.4
    * Send shutdown command to supervisord on backend failure
      and try to bring back first backend after all backends fail.
      This is default and non-configurable behavior.
      Requested by Grzegorz Nosek.

2010-01-04    VERSION 1.3
    * Add "supervisord_inherit_backend_status" directive.

    * Add "supervisord_start" and "supervisord_stop" handlers.

    * Add "none" as valid argument in "supervisord" directive.

    * Add patch against bulit-in load balancer.

      Combination of the above changes allows one to dynamically
      take backend servers out of rotation without the need to
      use supervisord daemon.
      Those changes were somehow inspired by James Byers's comment
      on Hacker News saying that nginx is missing such feature.

      For detailed description please check README file.

2009-11-19    VERSION 1.2
    * Don't run "monitors" on "cache manager" and "cache loader"
      processes (this could lead to crash of either of them 
      when ngx_supervisord-enable load balancer tried to access
      data available only on "worker" processes).

      Following applies only to versions older than nginx-0.8.28:
      NOTE: This modification uses undocumented nginx's "feature"
      to distinguish mentioned processes and starting from this
      release "worker_connections" cannot be set to 512 (it can be
      set to either lower or higher number, just not equal to 512).

    * patches: Workaround possible bug in nginx-upstream-fair.

2009-11-16    VERSION 1.1
    * Add "supervisord_name" directive (which overrides
      upstream{}'s name when communicating with supervisord).

2009-10-30
    * Allow module to compile with nginx-0.7.63+ and 0.8.7+.

2009-10-29    VERSION 1.0
    * Initial release
